A fun and simple classic Rock - Paper - Sciccors game written in Javascript

This webpage was created as a project/excercise of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). 

In this project i learned a lot about DOM Manipulation, CSS styling (hover, transform, transition etc) and i also improved my understanding of Javascript functions.
